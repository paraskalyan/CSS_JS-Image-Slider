#### You have to make some changes if you add or remove images:-
1. Width of the container:- Change width of the container acc. to number of images. Each image is 100vw. So, If there are 5 images then width of container will be 500vw.
2. JavaScript Code:- Change values of 'i' variable in JS code acc. to number of images.
